# Raining Humidity and Water Level Display

List of Materials:
-I2C LCD
-WATER LEVEL SENSOR
-TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR

Code Description
I connected the humidity sensor to analog pin A0 then connected the water level sensor to analog pin A1.
The reason I connect it to analog pins is because I want to get some external data.
We read both sensors with analog read and displayed the data on the screen as an LCD.
